# Systolic-Array-based-Image-Binarization-using-Basys3-FPGA-Board
In this project, image binarization results comparing the matrix operations obtained via software based and hardware based (fpga board) is shown.

This project Systolic Array RTL code and concepts are referred from the following repository:

[2D Systolic Array Multiplier by tms4517](https://github.com/tms4517/2D-Systolic-Array-Multiplier/tree/main/rtl).

We acknowledge and appreciate the work shared in the original repository.
